## 📟 About <a name = "about"></a>

Coding Challenges, Go, JavaScript, Databases, Computer Networking, Web Security, Web Applications, and Miscellaneous topics. As a reader I bet you are thinking Miscellaneous? That’s too general. Well, it gives me an excuse to write about anything I want without the reader harboring any thoughts of betrayal or heartrending sentiments.
